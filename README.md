# ✈️ CNN Object Detection (Airplane Detector)

This repository contains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**–based object detector
that detects airplanes from images. The project includes:

- A full training pipeline (data preprocessing → cropping → CNN training → saving model)
- A deployment/testing pipeline (load trained model → detect airplanes → draw detections)

## 🧠 Model Architecture (from code)

The CNN classifier defined in `Object_Detector_CNN_Based.ipynb`:

```

Input (CROP_SIZE x CROP_SIZE x 3)
│
├── Conv2D (32 filters, kernel 3x3, activation='relu')
├── MaxPooling2D (pool size 2)
│
├── Conv2D (64 filters, kernel 3x3, activation='relu')
├── MaxPooling2D (pool size 2)
│
├── Conv2D (128 filters, kernel 3x3, activation='relu')
├── GlobalAveragePooling2D
├── Dropout (0.40)
│
└── Dense (num_classes, activation='softmax')

```

The model is compiled with:

```

optimizer = Adam()
loss = SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()
metrics = ['accuracy']

````

## 🛠️ Training Pipeline (from notebook)

From `Object_Detector_CNN_Based.ipynb`:

1. Preprocess and crop dataset images into fixed-size patches (`CROP_SIZE × CROP_SIZE`)
2. Build CNN classifier using TensorFlow/Keras
3. Compute class weights using:

```python
from sklearn.utils import class_weight
cls_weights = class_weight.compute_class_weight('balanced', ...)
````

4. Train with callbacks:

```python
ModelCheckpoint(save_best_only=True, monitor="val_loss")
EarlyStopping(patience=5, restore_best_weights=True)
```

5. Save trained model to:

```
/artifacts/cnn_detector_best.h5
```

The notebook also plots **loss curve** and **accuracy curve** during training:

```python
plt.plot(history.history['loss'])
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'])
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'])
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'])
```

This is automatically generated inside the notebook (no user action needed).

## 🚀 Deployment / Inference Pipeline

From `Final_Testing.ipynb`:

1. Load trained model

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
cnn_model = load_model("/content/drive/MyDrive/airplane_cnn_model.keras")
print("✅ Model loaded successfully from Drive!")
```

2. Run detection on **a single image**

```python
img_rgb, detections = detect_airplanes(test_img_path, cnn_model, conf_thresh=0.4)
final_detections = non_max_suppression(detections, iou_thresh=0.2)

print(f"✅ Single image: {len(final_detections)} airplanes detected")
```

3. Run **batch detection** on a folder

```python
batch_detect(test_folder, cnn_model, conf_thresh=0.4, iou_thresh=0.2, limit=5, save_dir="/content/detection_results")
```

The script produces:

* Cropped detection previews
* Final output images stored under `/content/detection_results`

---

## 🔍 Object Detection Strategy (as implemented)

* Slide a fixed-size crop over the input image
* Run classifier on each crop
* Keep predictions above confidence threshold (`conf_thresh = 0.4`)
* Apply **Non-Max Suppression (NMS)** (`iou_thresh = 0.2`)
* Draw bounding box + label on final image

---

## ✅ Outputs Generated by the Project

The project automatically generates:

| Output                                       | Location                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Trained model                                | `artifacts/cnn_detector_best.h5` |
| Intermediate cropped chips                   | `artifacts/crops/`               |
| Final inference images (with bounding boxes) | `detection_results/`             |

When running inference, the console prints:

```
✅ Model loaded successfully from Drive!
✅ Single image: X airplanes detected
```
