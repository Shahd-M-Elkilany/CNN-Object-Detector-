# 🧠 CNN Object Detector

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Object Detection project** built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV.  
This repository contains two main Jupyter notebooks — one for **training** the model and another for **testing/deployment**.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cnn-object-detector.git
cd cnn-object-detector
````

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it:

**Windows**

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1️⃣ Training the model

Open the training notebook:

```
notebooks/Object_Detector_CNN_Based.ipynb
```

* Load dataset
* Run all cells to train the CNN model
* The trained model gets saved automatically

### 2️⃣ Testing / Deployment

Open the testing notebook:

```
notebooks/Final_Testing.ipynb
```

* Loads the saved model
* Performs prediction & visualization
* (Optional) Deploy model via Gradio UI
